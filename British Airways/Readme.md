# Project Title: Analysis of British Airways Data using Tableau

# Project Description:

In this project, we utilized Tableau to analyze and visualize data related to British Airways. Our primary focus was to gain insights into various aspects of the airline's operations and performance. To achieve this, we implemented the following key features in Tableau:

 Parameters: We created dynamic parameters that allowed us to filter and customize the data view. This flexibility enabled us to explore different scenarios and trends within the data.

Calculated Fields: We developed calculated fields to derive new metrics and perform complex data transformations. These calculations helped us uncover hidden patterns and relationships in the data.

Visualizations: We designed a range of visualizations, including plots and maps, to represent the data effectively. These visual tools provided a clear and intuitive way to interpret the findings.

Insights: Through our analysis, we discovered several valuable insights about British Airways. We identified key trends in flight operations, passenger preferences, and geographical reach. Our visualizations highlighted areas of strength and opportunities for improvement.

Conclusion:

The project demonstrated the power of Tableau in transforming raw data into actionable insights. By leveraging parameters, calculated fields, and visualizations, we were able to uncover meaningful patterns and trends related to British Airways. This analysis can serve as a foundation for strategic decision-making and further exploration in the aviation industry.
