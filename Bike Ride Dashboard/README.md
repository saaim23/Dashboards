# Bike-Ride-Dashboard
This project is a comprehensive analysis of bike rentals, conducted using Python and Tableau. The initial phase involved Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning using Python, preparing the data for visualization. Following this, we used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that provides key insights into the relationship between temperature, location, and the number of bike rentals. This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for extracting interesting insights and understanding the dynamics of bike rentals.
In addition to the initial analysis, we created a **heatmap** to illustrate the relationship between temperature, wind speed, weather conditions, and the hour of the day. This provided a visual representation of how these factors interact. 

We also calculated a **moving average** for the number of bike rentals over different periods - daily, weekly, and monthly. This helped us identify trends and patterns over time. 

Furthermore, we developed a sheet related to the date that displays the count of bikes rented. This allowed us to observe the fluctuations in bike rentals over time and understand the impact of specific dates or events on bike rental demand. 

These additional features enhanced the depth of our analysis and the utility of our Tableau dashboard. It not only provides a snapshot of the current situation but also allows for dynamic exploration of data to generate interesting insights.
